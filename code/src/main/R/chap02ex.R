# First, I'll load the data from the pregnancy file and select the records for

# Read NSFG data into a data.frame.

# Here's the histogram of birth weights in pounds. Notice that hist works with

# As an exercise, plot the histogram of pregnancy lengths (column prglngth).

# Methods to compute summary statistics:
mean(live[, "prglngth"])
var(live[, "prglngth"])
sd(live[, "prglngth"])

# As an exercise, confirm that std is the square root of var:
var(live[, "prglngth"]) == sd(live[, "prglngth"])^2

# Here's are the mean pregnancy lengths for first babies and others:
c(mean(firsts[, "prglngth"]), mean(others[, "prglngth"]))

# And here's the difference (in weeks):
mean(firsts[, "prglngth"]) - mean(others[, "prglngth"])

# This functon computes the Cohen effect size, which is the difference
# in means expressed in number of standard deviations:
cohen.d(firsts[, "prglngth"], others[, "prglngth"])

# Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter
# or heavier than others.
# Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups.
# How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

# For the next few exercises, we'll load the respondent file:

# Make a histogram of totincr the total income for the respondent's family. To
# interpret the codes see the codebook.
myhist(resp[, "totincr"], xlab="Income Bracket", ylab="Count",
       main = "Income Bracket of Respondent")

# Make a histogram of age_r, the respondent's age at the time of interview.
myhist(resp[, "age_r"], xlab="Age", ylab="Count", breaks=14:45,
       main = "Age of Respondent")

# Make a histogram of numfmhh, the number of people in the respondent's
# household.
myhist(resp[, "numfmhh"], xlab="People in Household", ylab="Count",
       breaks=0:9, main = "Household Size")

# Make a histogram of parity, the number of children borne by the respondent.
# How would you describe this distribution?
myhist(resp[, "parity"], xlab="Number of Children", ylab="Count",
       breaks=0:22, main = NA)

# Use Hist.Largest to find the largest values of parity.
tail(table(resp[, "parity"]), n=10)

# Let's investigate whether people with higher income have higher parity. Keep
# in mind that in this study, we are observing different people at different
# times during their lives, so this data is not the best choice for answering
# this question. But for now let's take it at face value.
# Use totincr to select the respondents with the highest income (level 14).
# Plot the histogram of parity for just the high income respondents.
high_income = resp[resp[, "totincr"] == 14, ]
